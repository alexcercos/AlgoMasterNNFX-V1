# Contributing in AlgoMaster NNFX

If you want to contribute, you can do so in several ways:

- Open issues if you find a bug (write detailed descriptions on how to replicate it).
- Send pull requests: to fix any open issue, refactor code, etc.
- Write documentation for the program: for now there is an User Guide in PDF (with some things not up to date). It would be of great help to 
convert part of its contents into documentation (.md files), add examples of use, etc.
